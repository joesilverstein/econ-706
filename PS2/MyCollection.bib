@article{Cooper1998,
	Abstract = {Diamond-Dybvig 1983 provide a model of intermediation in which bank runs are driven by pessimistic depositor expectations. Models which address these issues are important in the ongoing discussion which weighs the costs (incentive problems) and the benefits (preventing runs) of deposit insurance. In the present paper we extend the Diamond-Dybvig analysis to consider several important questions for evaluating deposit insurance that could not be addressed within their framework. First, we provide conditions for runs when banks can invest in both illiquid and liquid projects. This results in a weakening of the conditions necessary for bank runs relative to the Diamond-Dybvig model in which no liquid investments occur in equilibrium. Second, we characterize how banks respond to the possibility of runs in their design of deposit contracts and investment decisions, particularly through the holding of excess reserves. Finally, we use this framework to evaluate the costs and benefits of deposit insurance and other forms of intervention. To do so, we introduce moral hazard and monitoring into the model to explore the incentive effects of deposit insurance. The implementation of a capital requirement can, along with deposit insurance, support the optimal allocation.},

@article{Diamond2000,
	Abstract = {Banks can create liquidity precisely because deposits are fragile and prone to runs. Increased uncertainty makes deposits excessively fragile, creating a role for out- side bank capital. Greater bank capital reduces the probability of financial distress but also reduces liquidity creation. The quantity of capital influences the amount that banks can induce borrowers to pay. Optimal bank capital structure trades off effects on liquidity creation, costs of bank distress, and the ability to force borrower repayment. The model explains the decline in bank capital over the last two cen- turies. It identifies overlooked consequences of having regulatory capital require- ments and deposit insurance},

@article{Dybvig1986,
	Abstract = {The recent changes include new competitors to banks, new technology, new floating rate contracts, in- creases in interstate banking, and various regulatory reductions and changes. Some of these changes are accelerated by the current high rate of bank failure; many of the changes are driven by technology and competition and are inevitable. One implication of all these changes is that we now face policy decisions that will affect the future course of the banking industry. Since the current environment is largely outside our past experience, we need theory to extrapolate from past experi- ence to our current situation. The purpose of this paper is to sum- marize the policy implications of existing economic models of the banking industry and to examine some current recommendations in light of the theory. Our conclusions contrast with the traditional view in economics and with several conclusions in Kareken's (in this issue) lead piece in this symposium.},

	Abstract = {We argue here for a broader view of the biases in managers' decisions: In general, managerial rent-seeking affects not only the level of investment, but also the form. Our basic hypothesis is simple: given the now well-established scope for managerial discretion, managers have an incentive to exercise that discretion to enhance their income. Any managerial contract is subject to renegotiation, and a manager's pay is the outcome of an often bewildering bargaining process between management, the board of directors, and rival management teams or takeover artists.},

@article{Stiglitz1989,
	Abstract = {This paper explores the causes and consequences of the more important market failures which impede the development of LOCs, and explains why the non-market institutions which often ameliorate the effects of market failures in developed countries are less effective- in doing so in LOCs. This paper focuses, in particular, on those market failures which arise from imperfect information (as in the capital market) or which are almost inevitably associated with the learning which must occur if the less developed countries are successfully to make the transition to being more developed. learning, Among the consequences of learning-by-doing, of localized and of learning-to-learn are imperfections of competition, multiple equilibria, hysteresis, and the optimality of non-myopic policies. These market failures are markedly different from those that were the center of attention in earlier literature, which led to arguments for government planning. Government interventions need to recognize the source of market failures; informational problems affect the government no less than the private sector. In some cases, interventions should be directed at making markets work more effectively; in other cases, the government may take a role in establishing non-market institutions to ameliorate the effects of market failure.},

@article{Tabbae2012,
	Abstract = {This article provides empirical evidence of behavioural responses by banks in the recent crisis. Using firm-specific balance sheet data, we construct aggregate indicators of systemic risk. Measures of size and herding show that balance sheet adjustments have been pro-cyclical in the crisis, while responses became increasingly dependent across banks and concentrated on certain market segments. Banks reacted less according to a pecking order, as an indication of reduced flexibility in their risk management opportunities. The behavioural indicators are useful tools for monetary and macro prudential analyses and can contribute to the micro foundations of financial stability models.},
